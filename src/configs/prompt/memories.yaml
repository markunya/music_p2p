  [Pre-Chorus]
  Everybody hurts sometimes
  Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
  But everything gon' be alright
  Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

  [Chorus]
  Here's to the ones that we got
  Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
  'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
  Of everything we've been through
  Toast to the ones here today
  Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
  'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
  And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
